**What happens inside of asynchronous code?**

What happens inside asynchronous code? What to do if logic becomes cpu-bound? Is it possible to create the hybrid synchronous- asynchronous architecture? I will try to answer these questions in terms of Tornado application. I will make the visualization of application and suggest the  ways to solve some problems.
