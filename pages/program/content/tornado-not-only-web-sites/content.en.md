**Tornado – not only web-sites**

In «Ideco» we don’t do web-developing, we create solutions for web infrastructure which make complicated things easier. There is Linux and other system instruments laid in the depths of these solutions and there’s a good web-interface shown on the surface. Tornado takes the middle  and provides the connection between “top” and “bottom”. Why does it go this way and is why web-framework a successful decision for system programming? You will learn all of these issues from the report. Report will be helpful for Python-programmers, who want to learn the possibilities of Tornado, and also for developers of dispersed systems solving the problems of connection organization between components.
