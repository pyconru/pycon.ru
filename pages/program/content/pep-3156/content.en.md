**PEP 3156 â€” Standard of asynchronous IO Support Rebooted in Python.**
  
Python already has a lot of libraries for network programming. The most famous are twisted, tornado, gevent, medusa/asyncore. These systems are not compatible with each other, that does not give a possibility to write cross-platform libraries working in any event loop. PEP 3156 proposes new general standart, that will be able to support all developers.
