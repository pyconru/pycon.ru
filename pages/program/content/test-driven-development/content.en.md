**Test Driven Development in Python and Django.**    

In books, articles and videos most test examples are simplified to much. So it's very hard to apply these examples to real work. Real projects are not so simple. In real project we depend on internet connection, databases and filesystems. It's not obvious how to test such things. We will show test examples and tools that we use every day in our practice.
