**Building Public Infrastructure with Autosustainble Services**

Five years ago, I realized we needed a vehicle other than startups to build sustainable open source services. This need came from my own problem of building lots and lots of simple services (usually in Python) and not having the time or desire to build a business around them. These services include Localtunnel, RequestBin, Airscript, and others. Here I'll show these projects, their place in the ecosystem, and what I plan to do about making them sustainable.
