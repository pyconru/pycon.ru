**Andrew Svetlov**, Python Core Developer, co-organizer UA PyCon.  
**Workshop on creation network applications from scratch**  
  
Many programmers wrote asynchronous code using off-the-shelf solutions. The goal of the master-class is to show how all of this works inside. It will be interesting to those who have written the network code using off-the-shelf libraries, or those who want to learn how to do it. Participants will gain knowledge about the basic principles of creating asynchronous network libraries from low level constructions to easy-to-use constructions.
