**MongoEngine: NoORM for NoSQL**  

Nowdays non relational databases become more popular than relational, in particular, MongoDB. However, even experienced developers, who are familiar with relational databases, their experience don't help them and sometimes it interfere. I'll tell about using MongoEngine, which allows you to bring methods of application development by Python with using MongoDB to more traditional approaches. This will be useful all Python developers who have an interest in MongoDB and non relational databases.
