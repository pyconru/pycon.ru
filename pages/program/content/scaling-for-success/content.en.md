**Scaling for Success: How to build proper scalable web apps**

I'll talk about what I see as a successful scaling strategy for growing companies. Specifically it will focus on things you should avoid early on, and where you can get easy wins. Additionally I'll cover various high level components of an early scaling strategy such as database sharding, CDN caching, and overall architecture to simplify the growing pains.  
- How to approach sharding (architecture)   
- Horizontal vs vertical, which solution is right and when    
- How we sharded the Django ORM   
- Materialized views using Redis    
- Buffered counters using Redis
