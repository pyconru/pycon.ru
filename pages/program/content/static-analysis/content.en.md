**Static analysis of Python**

Static analysis provides the information of the source code without executing it. We'll consider available means of static analysis code by Python (PyLint, PyFlakes, Pep8, inspection IDE) and will talk about problems that they can find automatically in code. I'll talk about the approaches that are based static analysis in these tools and about the specifics of the analysis of Python as dynamic language.
Report introduces you whith tools of static analysis, using that in daily practice you can reduce quantity of problems in Python code (errors, exceptions, and stylistic differences).
