**Workshop: We will write your interpreter with using RPython**    

On this workshop we will see:    
  - the structure of the bytecode interpreter (almost all of modern interpreters for dynamic languages are such)    
  - what benefits give us using RPython in implementation(using in PyPy)    
  - and how JIT (just-in-time compiler) works    
The practical part will consist of implementing a few small parts - implementation of a new bytecode, adding just-in-time compiler, analyze and improve performance.Participants will learn what parts consist of interpreter and how it works, how the JIT works, why TDD is good, and then be able to write a quick little dynamic language interpreter for the weekend.
